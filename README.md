# QR-Code-Billboard-Project

The project is to implement a smart billboard that displays images. It also scans QR Codes to play specific mp4 files with audio.

The camera is always active, whenever the user scans QR Code a specific video linked to that QR Code is played immediately while the images are paused. After the video is played it goes back to the images slideshow.
